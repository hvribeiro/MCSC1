    "In grade school, you were introduced to the natural numbers (i.e., `1,2,3,..`)\n",
    "and you learned how to manipulate them by operations like addition,\n",
    "subtraction, and multiplication. Later, you were introduced to positive and\n",
    "negative numbers and were again taught how to manipulate them. Ultimately, you\n",
